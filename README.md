## Developing content

### Adding a new section

1. Create a new file in *sections/*, based on the files that are already
   there, with unique `permalink` and `chapter`. The `order` value is used to
   detemine the order they appear in the list on the website.
2. Edit *_config.yml* and add the new section file to the `header_pages` list.
3. Create a folder under *_lessons/* with the name used in `permalink` above.
   This is where the lessons will go.

### Adding a new lesson

1. Create a new file in the *_lessons/<section_name>/* folder, based on files
   that are already there.
2. Make sure the `permalink` is unique.
3. Make sure `chapter` matches the chapter that was set in the corresponding
   section file.
