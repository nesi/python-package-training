## Aim of this training

As Python has grown in popularity, the complexity of some Python packages has grown to the point where the way you interact with these can no longer be reduced to simple function calls. Examples of Python modules with an object oriented flair are `pandas` and `sklearn`. In each cases, you create an object, which "lives" for as long as you need it. During its life, you can operate multiple times on the objects. Objected oriented programming allows you to more complex tasks, sometimes in more efficient way, that a procedural approach. Upon completion of this training module, you will:

 * Know what object members and methods are
 * How to implement write a class 
 * How to create an object and operate on it 

## Prerequisites

To take this training you will need:

 * to be able to log into a Unix computer, be comfortable with typing Unix
 * know how to use an editor
 * have some basic knowledge of Python

## Getting ready

We will require Python 3.x with external packages installed. 

You're welcome to use your own Python development platform, including your laptop. If you choose to develop on NeSI, you can do so by 
```
module load Python
```

In a directory of your choice, execute 
```
mkdir my_oo_package
cd mkdir my_oo_package
```
