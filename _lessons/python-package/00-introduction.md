## Aim of this training

Long gone are the days when scientists would write code, compile it and run, and that was it! Today, with the proliferation of new tools and packages and libraries, software development has become a complex business. This training material is aimed at getting you started with serious Python code development. Upon completion of this training module, you will:

 * Know how to organise your package
 * How to build and install your package
 * How to document your package
 * Encourage contributions from others
 * And ensure that your package reamins robust during its development cycle

## Prerequisites

To take this training you will need:

 * to be able to log into a Unix computer, be comfortable with typing Unix
 * know how to use an editor
 * have some knowledge of Python

## Getting ready

We will require Python 3.x with external packages installed. 

You're welcome to use your own Python development platform, including your laptop. If you choose to develop on NeSI, you can do so by 
```
module load Python
```

In a directory of your choice, execute 
```
mkdir my_little_package
cd mkdir my_little_package
```
