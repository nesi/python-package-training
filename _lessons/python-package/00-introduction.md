## Aim of this training

Learn how to develop Python packages that can be easily shared with your collaborators.

## Prerequisites

To take this training you will need:

 * to be able to log into a Unix computer (and submit jobs if connected to a NeSI computer)
 * be comfortable with typing Unix and git commands
 * know how to use an editor
 * have some knowledge of Python

## Getting ready

We will require Python 3 with external packages installed. On NeSI's Mahuika Cray CS400 cluster do:

```
module load Python
```

## My little package

We will use the `my_little_package` code as an example.

## Checking out the code

Clone and switch to the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/jennan/my_little_package.git
cd my_little_package
```
